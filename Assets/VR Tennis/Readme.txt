Legal Stuff / Licensing:
------------------------
VR Tennis is licensed per-seat, as with all other editor extensions, according to Unity's EULA.
This means that in order for a team to use VR Tennis, everyone who want to be able to use it, needs their own license.
If you finish and release a product in Unity, using VR Tennis, I would appreciate a mention of VR Tennis in the credits :)
